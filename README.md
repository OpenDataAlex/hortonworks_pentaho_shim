hortonworks_pentaho_shim
========================

Shim needed to connect Pentaho Data Integration with the Hortonworks Sandbox.  

Put together based on material found at the following links:

Code belongs to their respective owners (Pentaho and Hortonworks).  Shim orignates as Pentaho's 'hadoop-20' shim with the necessary jar files 
from the sandbox replacing the originals.  
Placing this here in case anyone else wants to have a ready to go shim to play with.
